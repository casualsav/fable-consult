# fable-bench

One repo, two modes, gated by who's driving the session (this is the LITE
variant — no auto layer; consults are always on-demand):

1. **Manual `/fable`** (any below-Fable driver): an on-demand **Claude Fable 5
   plan-consult** on any task, then an **automatic warm diff-review** of the
   result. You drive; Fable consults. Nothing fires unless you type it.
2. **Lead playbook** (default whenever Fable itself is the driving model):
   consults are suppressed as redundant — Fable specs, reviews, and ships;
   the worker agents write the code. Same agents, same S5-alt mechanics.

The installed CLAUDE.md block is ~24 lines and applies only to Fable-led
sessions; below-Fable sessions ignore it and just have `/fable` available.

The philosophy: **you (Opus) hold full session context and do the work.** Fable 5 has stronger
judgment but zero session context, so it's a consultant you touch twice per `/fable`
— one plan consult before you build, one warm review of the diff after — plus at most one
exception-triggered mid-consult if a checkpoint or assumption Fable flagged fails mid-task.
It's the plan-and-review discipline of a heavier "Opus-drives / Fable-consults" config,
repackaged so **you decide when to invoke it** instead of it firing automatically.

## What it does

Run `/fable` on a nontrivial task and it drives this flow:

1. **Ground** — map the relevant code with `explorer` workers (scaled to the task) and capture the project's test command.
2. **Preflight** — confirm your harness can resume a subagent (the hard dependency below).
3. **Draft + draft check** — you write a short plan; a structural self-test (can you write the `REJECTED:` line?) picks *critique-my-draft*, *blind-sketch* (Fable sketches its approach before seeing your draft), or rarely *dual-plan*.
4. **Plan consult** — Fable returns a terse coded verdict (`ENDORSE / AMEND / REPLACE`).
5. **Execute** — you build it, logging deviations; if a Fable checkpoint or assumption fails, one warm mid-consult is allowed.
6. **Warm review** — the *same* Fable agent is resumed to review the diff (`SHIP / FIX-THEN-SHIP / RECONSULT`).
7. **Apply MUST-FIX, self-verify, ship** — no third consult.

Three additions from the execution-layer marriage:

- **Orchestrated parallel execution (S5-alt):** for a batch of independent items, the driver
  fans out to `coder` / `engineer` / `test-writer` workers in parallel,
  gates every result through `reviewer`, and sends the merged diff to the one warm
  review. Speed comes from parallelism; quality holds because of the gates. Dependent chains
  stay inline.
- **Batch mode:** ≤3 small, vetted, non-interacting drafts share one plan consult and one
  warm review — thinking overhead bills per engagement, so batching amortizes it.
- **Review-only mode:** pre-approved mechanical items skip the plan consult; a cold
  `REVIEW-ONLY` Fable engagement (or, for trivial diffs, the Sonnet `reviewer` at zero
  Fable) judges the result. Tiered so no diff is double-reviewed by default.

## Install

**Recommended — bare `/fable` (user-level skill):**

```
git clone https://github.com/casualsav/fable-bench
./fable-bench/install.sh
```

This copies the skills and agents into your Claude config dir
(`~/.claude`, or `$CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR`) and merges the auto-layer trigger policy
into that scope's `CLAUDE.md` behind sentinels. The installer asks two
questions (env vars skip them for
non-interactive installs):

1. **Fable plan-consult effort** (`FABLE_EFFORT`, recommended **high**).
2. **Fable review effort** (`FABLE_REVIEW_EFFORT`, recommended **medium**) —
   applied as the per-invocation override on the warm review, mid-consults, and
   cold REVIEW-ONLY engagements.

Worker efforts are pinned in frontmatter (they cost speed, not Fable):
verification + explore `low` · coder + smoke-tester `medium` · test-writer `high` ·
engineer + reviewer `high`.

User skills aren't namespaced, so the command is exactly `/fable`. Restart / reload your session after
installing.

**Alternative — as a plugin (namespaced `/fable-bench:fable`):**

```
/plugin marketplace add casualsav/fable-bench
/plugin install fable-bench
```

You get `/plugin`-managed updates, but Claude Code namespaces every plugin
command, so it invokes as `/fable-bench:fable` — not bare `/fable` — and the
workers are namespaced too (see the plugin note below). Pick this only if you
want the managed-update path over the clean name.

## Uninstall

If you used the script:

```
./fable-bench/uninstall.sh
```

If you installed the plugin:

```
/plugin uninstall fable-bench
/plugin marketplace remove casualsav/fable-bench
```

Either way, `/fable` writes nothing persistent beyond those files — its only
runtime state is an in-session task checkpoint that lives and dies with the
session — so nothing is left behind.

## Requirements

- **Claude Fable 5** access (the consultant agent runs `model: fable`; `install.sh` prompts
  for effort, recommended `high` — see below).
- **A harness that supports warm subagent-resume** (`SendMessage` to a spawned agent). The
  warm review resumes the plan agent; there is **no cold fallback**. If resume isn't available,
  `/fable` detects it at preflight and stops rather than half-running.

## Tuning Fable's effort

Fable's reasoning depth is set by the `effort:` frontmatter in the installed
`fable-planner` agent. `install.sh` **prompts** for it and writes your choice in —
**recommended: high** — Anthropic's own default for nontrivial work, and `/fable` only fires
on nontrivial work; Fable at medium buys little margin over the Opus driver (Fable-low is
comparable to Opus-xhigh). Raise to `xhigh` for a rare, capability-critical consult. One honest caveat: thinking
tokens bill at Fable's output rate ($50/MTok), so effort — not the visible reply caps — is
the biggest cost dial in the system; `medium` is the legitimate lever if usage limits bite:

```
./fable-bench/install.sh                      # prompts: low | medium | high | xhigh | max
FABLE_EFFORT=high ./fable-bench/install.sh     # or set it to skip the prompt / for CI
```

Re-run with a new value to change it. (**Two efforts now govern the two engagements** —
verified: changing effort mid-conversation does NOT invalidate the message cache. The
frontmatter effort applies to the plan consult; the warm review and any exception mid-consult
are resumed with a per-invocation override to `medium`, since they're bounded judgment
against an already-vetted plan. This makes `xhigh` plan consults affordable: the deep
thinking is spent once, not twice. If you install via `/plugin` instead of `install.sh`, the
shipped default is `high`; edit the agent's `effort:` frontmatter to change it.)

## What's inside

| File | Role |
|---|---|
| `skills/fable/SKILL.md` | The `/fable` flow + all the consult discipline (brief format, coded-output decoding, bindingness). |
| `skills/fable-method/SKILL.md` | Fable’s working method distilled for the Opus driver — decomposition, self-verification, next-action selection. Load at the start of any nontrivial task. |
| `agents/fable-planner.md` | The Fable 5 consultant — dual-mode: plan critique, and warm review when resumed. |
| `agents/explorer.md` | Sonnet discovery worker (grounds the brief; also spawned by the consultant for its own search). |
| `agents/verifier.md` | Haiku test/lint/build runner (returns distilled pass/fail for self-verify). |
| `agents/coder.md` | Sonnet worker: small, precisely-specced fixes. Gated by `reviewer`. |
| `agents/engineer.md` | Sonnet worker: behavior-preserving structural refactors, tests-first on uncovered code. |
| `agents/test-writer.md` | Sonnet worker: characterization/regression tests; orchestrator escalates gnarly cases with a spawn-time model/effort override. |
| `agents/reviewer.md` | Sonnet read-only gate: reviews worker diffs under a below-Fable driver (a Fable lead reads diffs itself); also the zero-Fable review tier and the degraded fallback when a warm-review handle is lost. |
| `agents/smoke-tester.md` | Sonnet live prober: drives the real running app end-to-end post-deploy — green unit tests are not the finish line. |
| `install.sh` / `uninstall.sh` | User-level install of the skill + agents into `~/.claude` (`$CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR`), giving bare `/fable`. |
| `.claude-plugin/` | Manifests for the alternative `/plugin` install (namespaced `/fable-bench:fable`). |

## Plugin note (only if you chose the plugin path)

The script install puts the agents at user level, where they resolve by bare name
(`explorer`, `fable-planner`, `verifier`) — exactly what `SKILL.md` and
`fable-planner.md` reference — so there's nothing to check.

The **plugin** path is different: Claude Code namespaces plugin subagents (e.g.
`fable-bench:explore`). After a plugin install, run one `/fable` on a throwaway
task and confirm the discovery and verification workers resolve; if bare names
don't, qualify them in `agents/fable-planner.md` (its nested `explorer` spawn) and
in `SKILL.md`. This mismatch is the main reason the script install is recommended.
